### This is my first blog ever !! Even though I am just still a beginner in programming, I already had two years of intensive coding and I hope you will enjoy the experiences I have to share

I gotta say I didnt start **programming** because all of the sayings such as "Job warranty", "This is a super hot suject", "You will be super rich",...

It all began while I was playing computer games at home, chilling after finishing the intense highschool entrance test. Just as my screen was grey in the middle of a League of Legends match, I got a call from my best friend.

"Wanna join a coding class? Its about to start", he said

Then all of the sudden, the then ever-rising **competitiveness** with my friends (I used to think whatever they knew I must learn as well) had urged me to abandon my game, which caused me to drop some rank points :(, and head straight to the class in HUS

And my passion for coding all started in this website

This is a common website for most informatics majors in HUS and since I took this summer class, I sneaked an account on Codefun.

My first lines of code, pretty stupid common error right :)) But I know as a beginner then I was sympathized by most

After that it were some of the most **passionate** days of my life. I could feel every problem solved was exciting. The minute I saw each green tick on each problem was a reward for all the instructions in our secret book, all the stackoverflow, all the lines of code we minutely copied online not understanding why it didnt work.

It was quite a hectic summer but when the new school year was about to come, I left all the passion for coding behind and focused on studying Math (a thing that I still both regret and am grateful for). I was in the National Mathematics Team twice but got the honorable prize twice, quite ashamed :))

Then, the passion for coding in me arose again when I saw this really cool Codeathon from Techkids (Mindx now) and I was really grateful for having seen that advertisement. I immediately signed up for the **2-day** codecamp (sounds weird) but they were 2 days of 24 hours coding and learning about the thing that made me love coding today **web-dev**.

In the end, after the successful camp (we won first place :)), my passion for web-dev and coding in general was **ignited** again... Here are some of the first html, css and javascript I designed for the codeathon:

Pretty cool right !

In summary, I studied different languages such as python, java, c++ (for the sake of learning **algorithms**), and my specialities are **javascript and React** so you will expect many posts related to these 2 languages.

Even though I am not any professional developers or informatics major students, I believe on this blog you will find a lot of helpful **advice and experience** that I gathered during my 2 years of learning web-dev.

### Hope you enjoy it!
