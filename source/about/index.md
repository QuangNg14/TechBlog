## Welcome everyone to my code blog! You can check out all of my projects in this link below
**[Quang's projects](http://decodecraft.com/MyProject/)**

My name is Nhat Quang (my ingame name is Snoo) and I am 18 years old. My home is in Hanoi Vietnam. I studied at Hanoi Amsterdam for 7 years class 13-20 and will be an Engineering Student at Rice University class 2024 (Houston, Texas). 

There sure are a lot of great coding and programming blogs you can find on the internet and I hope that this blog can become useful or interesting to you. I believe, as for most programmers and developers, keeping a blog can help express  ideas and thoughts in words which makes the flow of thinking clearer. 

I began my coding journey 3 years ago and I have learnt and grown a lot since then. However, the high school years have kept me so busy that only until now do I have the time to keep a blog running. 

I am a math student and I really love the way mathematics and coding connects to each other. Every time I fix a bug or  finish a problem or learn a new technique or algorithm, excitement sparks inside me. Through my time involving in the world of programmers, I am specifically fascinated with fullstack developers (for now) so I love creating websites and applications. I believe that crafting a functional website from scratch can really help me understand the mind process of developers and improve my coding skills. 

I am definitely not a professional programmer so I don't expect to "teach" anyone how to code. I created this blog just to share with everyone the experiences, techniques and knowledge that I collected during my journey with coding. Seeing dynamic and beautiful websites everyday with increasingly advanced techniques inspired me to learn coding everyday. 

Thank you for reading my story and thoughts. 
### I hope you will enjoy this blog and maybe find something interesting that is connected to your lives. I believe great things can be achieved from small lines of code!
